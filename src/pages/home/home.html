      <h1>Test 1</h1>
      <p>
        This test shows a page with an &lt;ion-slides&gt; control. The control
        has 2 single normal slides, each of which is a custom component.
        Then there is a call to third custom control which is another &lt;ion-slides&gt; control
        with 2 slides in it. So, the page should swipe like their are 4 slides.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Outcome
      </h4>
      <p style="font-style:italic">
        The 4 slides appear. However, the 2 slides which are in one custom control
        are strangely offset making it unusable. You can see them both after VERY
        exagerated swiping.

      <p>
        This test shows a page with an &lt;ion-slides&gt; control. The control
        has 2 single normal slides, each of which is a custom component.
        Then there is a call to third custom control which has 2 &lt;ion-slide&gt; components in it,
        NOT within an &lt;ion-slides&gt; component. So, the page should swipe like their are 4 slides.

      <h4>
        Outcome
      </h4>
      <p style="font-style:italic">
        3 of 4 slides appear. The first two, which are each independent components, and the 1st
        slide of the next custom component which contains 2 &lt;ion-slide&gt; components in it. The
        second slide doesn&quot;t render at all.

      <h2>Desired Outcome</h2>
      <p>Ideally I get a working page with a custom component then can be multiple slides.
         I want to be able build a custom slideshow made with reusable subsets of slides. Like building
         a master process from sub-processes. You should be able to swipe back and forth between
         all slides as expected.
